this project is a tool to encode messages in the additive stereo channels for wave files. Essentially this tool reads in a wav file parses it for data and encodes a message normalized to resemble the already present data in a new audio channel for the given wav. 

There is also a program to decode the message. 

This encoding of data should not change the resultant audio of the output wav file. 

This only works on 16-bit audio
